# Backbone API: iTunes

Backbone.js helper for API requests to the iTunes service


## Install

Using Bower:
```
bower install backbone.api.itunes
```

## Usage

The namespace used for this extension is ```Backbone.API.iTunes```, and everything lives under that
````
Backbone.API.iTunes
				|- Models
				|	|- Item
				|
				|- Collections
					|- Search
					|- Lookup

````

Optionally, the namespace is mapped to the global ```iTunes```, in which case the ```Backbone.API.``` prefix can be left out.
